# Psyche

This project is an early experiment where I tried to build something alike a human soul on my computer. 
Rather than orienting on contemporary science and following the beaten path I tried to project my personal understanding of the human psyche into code. 
So it can be seen as a philosophic or sipritual project as well.

## What is a Soul?
In this program, a soul is based on a weighted, directed graph between objects of the mind. The edges in this graph represent associations, where its weight represents the strength of the association. 
Objects of the mind include inner representations of objects of the real world (a table, another person, ...), events (somebody speaks of something, ...), memories of such events, feelings or anything else.
The soul is able to register new events with old or new objects of the mind and is able to strengthen or weaken associations accordingly and thus learn.
It can also react emotionally depending on what it has learned but also what associations it started (was born) with.

## How can this Soul be experienced?
There is a text-based command line with a few commands and a simple grammar to present new events to the soul and notice its reactions. There is also a small UI that shows the 
graph of associations in a window.

## How can I try this myself?
If there is anybody interested in playing around with this project please send me an e-mail and I will try to figure out again how everything worked and write a few instructions :)
